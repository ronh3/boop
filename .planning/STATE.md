# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Milestone]: Treat this as brownfield pre-1.0 hardening, not a greenfield MVP.
- [Roadmap]: Use the research-backed six-phase order, with REL-03 assigned to final live release verification.
- [Scope]: Do not edit package source, version fields, or generated build artifacts during roadmap creation.
- [Phase 02]: Plan 02-01 kept production runtime behavior unchanged and added RED contract tests for downstream Phase 02 implementation.
- [Phase 02]: Plan 02-01 used owned-domain helper setup for blocker and automation-intent fixtures instead of flat state compatibility keys.
- [Phase 02]: Plan 02-02 kept production behavior unchanged and added Wave 0 contracts for GMCP recovery, target-loss cleanup, pull holds, trace, and canonical blocker UI rendering.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- State-domain drift, autowalk coverage gaps, gag fixture fragility, manifest parity risk, and missing version-sync enforcement drive the phase order.
- Orchestrator must handle the required boop version bump and commit after roadmap review.
